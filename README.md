This is my CITS3002 project, runs on LINUX system with Firefox Web Browser.
		  Java and python code files are in the same folder(project).

To run only java server: ./sJava.sh

To run only python server: ./pythonS.sh

To run both: ./both.sh

To kill process: ps -ef | grep process_name | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
