Ka Hou Hong(22085304) 
This is my CITS3002 project, runs on LINUX system with Firefox Web Browser.
		  Java and python code files are in the same folder(project).

(need to wait a few seconds for compilation ./sJava.sh, because it will compile all Java files)

To run only java server: ./sJava.sh

To run only python server: ./pythonS.sh

To run both: ./both.sh

To kill process: ./killservers.sh

Kind Regards
